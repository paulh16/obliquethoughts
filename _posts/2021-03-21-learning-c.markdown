The [CSI program](https://www.paulghaddad.com/the-start-of-bradfield-cs) is roughly broken into three phases: prep; instruction and
project. Right now, we’re wrapping up the prep phase. This phase is
self-directed and covers five topics: C, Go, Algorithms and Data Structures,
Discrete Math, and the Unix Shell. In this post, I’ll describe my approach to
learning C, which was the most challenging part of the prep work for most of my
cohort.

* The _C Programming Language_, better known as K&R for its authors, was the primary
recommended resource. I had previously worked through the book and most of its
exercises. I created an approach, which included solving challenging problems
from several C-related resources. I settled on five:

* Exercism: I’ve been a fan of Exercism for a long time. It offers a large
selection of problems and feedback from mentors and other community solutions,
which can help you to better improve your code.

* _The Practice of Programming_ by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike: While this book
isn’t exclusively on C, it’s used throughout. It covers the foundations of
programming, such as Algorithms and Data Structures, Design and Implementation,
Testing, among many other topics. I was able to learn C as well as other
foundational programming concepts. I also found the practice problems especially
helpful in using C in more real-world situations.

* _Programming Pearls_ by Jon Bentley: Again, this is not a book devoted solely to
C, but it contains very interesting and challenging problems. On top of this, it
presents some advanced programming techniques and practices taught through the
eyes of a master programmer.

* [CS61C](https://cs61c.org/): This computer architecture course at Cal Berkeley has interesting
homework assignments and projects to put your C skills to the test. One of my
favorites was implementing Git in C.
The next step was designing a learning strategy. In the past, I would go through
a book from cover to cover, doing the problems along the way. This time, I chose
to solve problems first. But not just any problem. I start with an interesting
problem that’s just outside my comfort zone, and struggle through it,
referencing books and resources only when needed.

This problem-first approach is challenging, but what I’ve found is that my
knowledge is much more robust than going through a book cover-to-cover in a
linear fashion.

The main issue I see with the linear approach is the problems you work on
immediately follow the concept in the book. With the material fresh in your
mind, it’s often easier to come to the solution. Furthermore, before you even
start, you know the concept that you need to apply for the specific problem.
However, this approach isn’t realistic.

When you encounter a problem in the real world, you often have no idea what part
of the language will be useful or technique that would work. You’re forced to
think through how to solve the problem, using the best tool in the toolbox — not
necessarily the latest one you learned about.

Finding a set of resources and completing challenging problems is not enough,
however. It’s critical to get feedback on your solutions. Ideally, this is from
someone who really knows the language and has better skills than you. Most of
the time, though, we aren’t lucky enough to have someone that can review every
problem. I’ve found a solution that is almost as good: review solutions of
others that have solved the problem.

I found these solutions really helpful in picking up C. Both allow you to
compare your solutions with those of expert programmers, and completes the loop
from solving the problem yourself to learning better ways of solving the
problem. You also learn new tools for future problems you encounter.

* _The C Answer Book_ by Clovis Tondo and Scott Gimpel. This book has all of the
solutions to the problems in K&R.

* Oz’s Solutions: Oz, one of our instructors, has literally hundreds of solutions
across many languages in his [solutions repo](https://github.com/ozan/solutions) on Github. Many of the K&R and
Exercism problems are available there. I have picked up many techniques and new
ways of doing things just by studying Oz’s code.
Learning any new skill can be challenging, particularly C, so it’s important to
have a strategy from the outset. My strategy of starting off with problems just
outside the edge of my abilities, having a great set of resources to learn from,
and getting feedback from someone more experienced than myself.
